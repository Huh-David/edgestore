# About Edge Store

Edge Store is a service designed to simplify file uploads in Next.js projects. Initially focusing on Next.js, with plans to expand to other frameworks in the future, it provides developers with a range of tools to streamline the file management process. The core of the service is built around an easy integration through a type-safe npm package, allowing a smooth incorporation into your existing projects.

The service offers functionalities such as customizable file validation and a dashboard to manage your projects and files. To facilitate quick deliveries worldwide, it utilizes CloudFront’s CDN.
